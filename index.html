            <em>This news release contains 'forward-looking statements'
             within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
              Forward-looking statements are statements that are
               not historical facts and are generally, but not always,
                identified by words such as the following: expects, plans,
                 anticipates, believes, intends, estimates, projects, assumes,
                  potential and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements 
                  also include reference to events or conditions that will, would,
                   may, could or should occur, including, without limitation, the
                    intended use of proceeds of Mirasol's rights offering. These 
                    forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number
                     of estimates and assumptions that, while based on management's
                      expectations and considered reasonable at the time they are made,
                       are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties
                        which could cause actual events or results to differ materially
                         from those reflected in the forward-statements, including,
                          without limitation: uncertainties related to raising sufficient
                           financing to fund planned work in a timely manner and on acceptable
                            terms; changes in planned work resulting from logistical, technical
                             or other factors; the possibility that results of work will not 
                             fulfill projections/expectations and realize the perceived potential
                              of the Company's projects
